# SVG-Logo-Maker

A Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and saves it as an SVG file. Please enjoy and review this command-line.

It utilizes the command-line to prompt a user a series of easy to follow simple questions. Once the user answers all the questions, then a SVG file is written using the selections based on the users answers and will generate a logo for them to appear. This project helped me learn the ability of the features that can be done on the back-end side without needing to have a user interface.Futhermore, I do hope to expand my learning and understand the many functionalities that can be performed.


Here is a link that shows a video of the program in action: (https://watch.screencastify.com/v/aw9bbzZ6nhJ5dydwhbso)
